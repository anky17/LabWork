# LAB WORK

This repository is organized into two main folders: CA (Computer Architecture) and DSA (Data Structure and Algorithms). Each folder contains subfolders and files corresponding to various concepts and implementations within the respective fields.

## CA - Computer Architecture

In the CA folder, you will find materials and code snippets implemented using VHDL. This includes:

- Adder Logic
- Basic Gates
- Decoder
- Encoder
- Parallel Adder
- Parallel Subtractor
- Subtractor Logic
- Universal Gates

## DSA - Data Structure and Algorithms

In the DSA folder, the focus shifts to programming concepts, specifically related to algorithms. This includes:

- DMA
- Hashing
- List
- Queue
- Recursion
- Searching
- Sorting
- Stack
