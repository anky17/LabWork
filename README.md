# LAB WORK

This repository is organized into four main folders: CA (Computer Architecture), DSA (Data Structure and Algorithms) and Sutherland Line and Polygon Clipping of Computer Graphics. Each folder contains subfolders and files corresponding to various concepts and implementations within the respective fields.

## CA - Computer Architecture

In the CA folder, you will find materials and code snippets implemented using VHDL. This includes:

- Adder Logic
- Arithmetic and Logic Unit
- Basic Gates
- Decoder
- Encoder
- MUX and DEMUX
- Parallel Adder
- Parity generator and checker
- Parallel Subtractor
- Subtractor Logic
- Universal Gates

## DSA - Data Structure and Algorithms

In the DSA folder, the focus shifts to programming concepts, specifically related to algorithms. This includes:

- DMA
- Hashing
- List
- Queue
- Recursion
- Searching
- Sorting
- Stack

## CLIPPING ALGORIHTM

This includes the clipping of line and polygon using various clipping algorithm.

- Line Clipping
- Polygon Clipping
